        <h3>Projects & Learning</h3>
        <p>I spent much of summer 2024 in an internship in the research group of <a href="https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mcarreira-perpinan/">Prof. Miguel Á. Carreira-Perpiñán</a> at the University of California, Merced, working on a research project about <a href="cubist-TAO/index.html">transforming images into a cubist style</a> using the <a href="https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mcarreira-perpinan/research/TAO.html">Tree Alternating Optimization (TAO)</a> algorithm.</p>
        <p>Currently, I am exploring different concepts in machine learning, computer science, and game development. I plan to work on personal projects in the near future and look forward to sharing my work here once I dive deeper into coding and development.</p>
